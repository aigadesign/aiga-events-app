UberHttp (Android)
==================

Utility project for providing common HTTP services for Android projects.


Requirements:
-----------------

The project requires the following permissions to be added to the manifest for the application:

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

Gradle Build System
-------------------

Early support for Gradle is available. The output of the Gradle build should not be used for client
projects however.

To build the debug and release AAR files run this command:

    gradle clean assemble

The AAR files can be found in `build/libs`.

To publish the release artifacts to the local Maven repository run this command:

    gradle publishToMavenLocal

To generate a release library ZIP (similar to the output of the Ant generate_library target run this command:

    gradle clean generateReleaseLibrary

The release library ZIP can be found in `build/distributions`.

To run the test against all connected devices run this command:

    gradle clean connectedCheck
