Constructing API Request URLs
Eventbrite API request URLs are composed of the following components:

term	definition
protocol	http or https. SSL-encrypted https connections are definitely preferred.
hostname	Our API services are available on our app domain.
data-type	xml or json data-types are supported.
API method	Navigate our API method pages to find out which service call will provide the data you need.
authentication tokens	Each of our supported authentication schemes are covered on our authentication page. Most API requests involve sending an app_key parameter, available here.
request parameters	Key/Value pairs of request data, as defined in each of our API method pages.
Put all these pieces together in order, and you should end up with a URL that looks something like this:

https://www.eventbrite.com/json/event_search?app_key=YOUR_API_KEY&keywords=super%20fun
NOTE: Your authentication tokens and method request parameters must be urlencoded and formatted as a valid URL querystring segment.

Our available API Client libraries automatically encode requests and parse responses, providing local language support for each of our API methods.


FROM DENISE WOOD 11/18/13:
However, based on our discussions and input from Winfield & Co, we will probably move forward with the following:

AIGA will maintain a list in Google Docs that has each chapter's Eventbrite "Organizer name" and email address. The iKit could pull from that to populate events , as could you and our other development partners. That way instead of that crucial information being stored on iKit, it could all be centrally managed by AIGA and easy to consume by different services. Google docs has an API which can be used to pull out the rows. 

This seems to jive with your your instinct to use  the EventBrite "organizer_list_events" API call .

At this time, though, the Google doc does not exist, and we don't actually even have Eventbrite account info for anyone. We can request this from chapters over the next few weeks. In the meantime, we have identified three chapters that have activated the Eventbrite integration from within the iKit:

Dallas - http://www.eventbrite.com/org/3188162?s=18900365
Raleigh - http://www.eventbrite.com/org/611807885?s=18125849
Arizona - http://www.eventbrite.com/org/367181403?s=19703055

In terms of art elements, chapters should be uploading them to etouches or Eventbrite. Let's return to this issue once you've been able to experiment with one or more of the chapters' feeds listed above.

So I think we are tentatively figuring out some ways to move forward; do you agree? I hope you are understanding that this is all pretty new and we are still figuring things out.



API call to get events:

"json/event_search"
    
params = organizer : organizerID,
           app_key : EVENTBRITE_API_KEY
