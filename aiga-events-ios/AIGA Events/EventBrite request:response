Their firm, Vignelli Associates, established in New York in 1971, has designed corporate identity programs for Knoll, American Airlines, Bloomingdale\u2019s, Xerox, Lancia, Cinzano, and Ford Motors. The company also designed glassware for Venini, Steuben, and Sasaki and showrooms for Artemide and Hauserman. Massimo Vignelli has created furniture designs for Sunar, Rosenthal, Morphos, and Knoll, including the well-known Handkerchief Chair and Paper Clip table for Knoll. The Vignellis are extremely versatile designers whose work is distinguished by clean, bold lines and a confident use of pure color. There is little that they have not conceived and executed, including directional signage for the New York and Washington, DC, subway systems and for the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum, designed by the architect Frank O. Gehry in Bilbao, Spain.

He and his firm May & Co. have received numerous awards for creative excellence from professional organizations and international competitions, including Communication Arts, D&AD and Graphis,\u00a0CIO Magazine,\u00a0CA Interactive,\u00a0Graphis New Media, the Web Marketing Association.\u00a0A native Texan, Doug holds design degrees from the University of North Texas and Art Center College of Design. He began his career in New York in 1980 before returning to Dallas to eventually open his own design office. Doug was honored as an AIGA Fellow in 2011 by the DFW Chapter, for his contribution to the North Texas design community.\u00a0</P>\r\n<P>Join us as at our next Seasoned Pros AIGA/DFW talk, as Doug examines how it has become more challenging today for a communications design practice to innovate and add economic value in this age of uncertainty. Doug says, \u201cOur design community must strive for a more complete understanding of its value. Creative minds have much more to offer business and society at large than aesthetics alone. We need to identify and address the obstacles that are restricting the creative community\u2019s full economic potential\u201d.</P>", "end_date": "2013-04-17 21:00:00", "tags": "", "timezone_offset": "GMT-0500", "text_color": "005580", "title_text_color": "", "tickets": [{"ticket": {"description": "", "end_date": "2013-04-17 16:30:00", "min": 1, "max": null, "price": "11.54", "visible": "true", "start_date": "2013-03-21 09:50:00", "currency": "USD", "display_price": "10.00", "type": 0, "id": 17052486, "name": "Members"}}, {"ticket": {"description": "", "end_date": "2013-04-17 16:30:00", "min": 1, "max": null, "price": "22.09", "visible": "true", "start_date": "2013-03-21 09:50:00", "currency": "USD", "display_price": "20.00", "type": 0, "id": 17052488, "name": "Non-members"}}, {"ticket": {"description": "", "end_date": "2013-04-17 16:30:00", "min": 1, "max": null, "price": "6.27", "visible": "true", "start_date": "2013-03-21 09:50:00", "currency": "USD", "display_price": "5.00", "type": 0, "id": 17053318, "name": "Students"}}, {"ticket": {"description": "", "end_date": "2013-04-17 16:30:00", "min": 1, "max": null, "price": "6.27", "visible": "true", "start_date": "2013-03-21 09:50:00", "currency": "USD", "display_price": "5.00", "type": 0, "id": 17053320, "name": "Emerging designers"}}, {"ticket": {"description": "", "end_date": "2013-04-17 17:00:00", "min": 1, "max": null, "price": "0.00", "visible": "false", "currency": "USD", "display_price": "0.00", "type": 0, "id": 18185665, "name": "BOGO"}}], "created": "2013-02-05 16:11:42", "url": "https://seasonedpros-spring.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebapi", "box_text_color": "000000", "privacy": "Public", "venue": {"city": "Dallas", "name": "Blanks Printing", "country": "United States", "region": "TX", "longitude": -96.823110999999997, "postal_code": "75208", "address_2": "", "address": "2343 North Beckley Avenue", "latitude": 32.772388999999997, "country_code": "US", "id": 3361917, "Lat-Long": "32.772389 / -96.823111"}, "modified": "2013-04-22 03:20:21", "logo_ssl": "https://ebmedia.eventbrite.com/s3-build/images/1332413/13688184231/1/logo.png", "repeats": "no"}}, {"event": {"box_header_text_color": "404040", "locale": "en_US", "link_color": "0f90ba", "box_background_color": "ffffff", "timezone": "America/Chicago", "box_border_color": "dedede", "logo": "http://ebmedia.eventbrite.com/s3-build/images/1452421/13688184231/1/logo.jpg", "organizer": {"url": "http://aigadfw-tx.eventbrite.com", "description": "The purpose of AIGA is to further excellence in communication design as a broadly defined discipline, strategic tool for business and cultural force.

He was inducted into the Anderson School Hall of Fame in 2012. In May of 2013 Don received the first Advertising Innovation & Marketing Excellence (AIME) Award presented by the Dallas/Fort Worth American Marketing Association, American Advertising Federation and the DREAM Fund. <BR><BR>Don is currently serving as Chairman of the National Paper Trade Association, is a past president and an active current board member of the DREAM Fund, Baylor Healthcare Foundation Board member, Dallas Arboretum Advisory Council member, and a member of the Frost Bank Advisory Board.
