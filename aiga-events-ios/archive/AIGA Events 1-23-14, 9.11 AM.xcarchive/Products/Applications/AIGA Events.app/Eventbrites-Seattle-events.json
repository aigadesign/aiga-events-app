That same creativity, when focused on a community, can bring about solutions that light a fire under it's residents and inspire them to change the world, starting with their very own block. AIGA Seattle would like to introduce a new kind of event. One where we gather 30 creative thinkers under the same roof to solve a community problem through sustainable design thinking. We call it Paper Airplane, and it's a <EM>design for community</EM> movement.</SPAN>\r\n<P> </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Design Challenge:</STRONG> <BR><EM>Solve the problem assigned to you in a way that is <STRONG>actionable</STRONG>, <STRONG>sustainable</STRONG>, and <STRONG>for the community</STRONG>.</EM></P>\r\n<P> </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Details:</STRONG><BR><SPAN STYLE=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">On the third Saturday of 2014, we will gather at the Good Shepherd Community Center to embark on an all day design-thinking extravaganza.
